# This project has been moved to SpotBot
# Toad-Sings-Discord-Bot 
Toad Sings is a Discord music bot which can play any link on youtube using Youtube_dl. It's current main purpose was a testing project that I wanted to see how this works. Now, it works as it should and I thought it'll be a good idea if I release it to the public.

## How to use:
Run bot.py and then you'll get an error about the token. That's normal. Open the config.json file in data folder. Then paste in your discord bot's token in the "Token:". 
You Can also change the prefix in the config.json where it says "Prefix:".
